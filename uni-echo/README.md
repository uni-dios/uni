# UNI Phase Echo

**Phase Echo** enhances the engineâ€™s linguistic capabilities with full Part-of-Speech tagging and phrase extraction.

Key features:
- Integration of part-of-speech tagging libraries
- Extraction of noun and verb phrases
- Refined input handling using linguistic roles (subject, predicate, object)

This phase is the final step before deeper syntax parsing, preparing UNI for full dependency and constituency parsing in Phase Foxtrot, where the engine begins to **self-learn** new structures and evolve its understanding without manual pattern definitions.
