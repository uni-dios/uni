# UNI Phase Delta

**Phase Delta** brings rule-based interpretation to the system. The engine can now match sentence structures using reusable parsing logic and recognize intent without regex.

This phase:
- Uses deterministic parsing to abstract user input into generalized patterns
- Categorizes parsed elements into tokens, phrases, and roles (e.g., subject, verb, object)
- Enables multiple sentence patterns to match a single intent

By this phase, UNI behaves more like a language operating system â€” capable of converting complex input into executable protocols through parsing alone.
