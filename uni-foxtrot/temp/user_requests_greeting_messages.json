For example, use the existing patterns as a reference. Only return back the pattern itself, without any additional text or explanation. Do not include improper grammar patterns. Make sure the RegEx is correct as well. Match groups should be used where appropriate, and the pattern should be robust enough to match variations of the phrase. Use `\\s+` like the other patterns for space characters between words. Always include the space at the beginning for each optional word or word group. \n\nFor example, for the phrase \"Hello, there!\", we would use \"hello\", \"hi\", and \"hey\" as they are common greeting phrase starters. We would then add an optional comma right after, and then an optional group of words that start with a space character to make it easier to parse. The pattern would most likely follow this pattern in this case: `^(hello|hi|hey)(,)?(\\s+there|\\s+you)?$` This patterns fits our rules. The word `here` doesn't make sense to be optional, as it's strange to say, \"hello here\". It starts with a mandatory key word, has an optional comma, followed by a group of optional words with their own space character for easy parsing. Don't forget optional punctuation at the end as such \"(.!)?\".\n\nOutput must be in json format like this:\n\n{\n    \"pattern\": \"^words in the pattern( with optional text)?$\",\n    \"groups\": [\"group1\", \"group2\", ...],\n}\n\nNo ticks or special characters around the pattern. Just the proper JSON formatted pattern itself and the groups it matches. Use escape characters on special characters like quotes, backslashes, etc. in the pattern.\n\nMake sure that JSON values have double quotes around them, not single quotes. The groups should be the names of the groups in the RegEx pattern.\n\nFor example, asking for how many letters in a word, there are two groups: the letter itself and the word it's in.\n"
