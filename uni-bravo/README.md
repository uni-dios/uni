# UNI Phase Bravo

**Phase Bravo** introduces the dynamic loading and execution of *protocol modules* — Python scripts that represent intent-handling logic.

This phase enables:
- Runtime execution of functions mapped to regex-identified intents
- Decoupling of logic into modular `protocols/` folders
- Deterministic responses based on matched function names

This begins the engine's ability to “do” something based on understanding — such as replying to input or performing a calculation.
