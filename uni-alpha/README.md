# UNI Phase Alpha

**Phase Alpha** is the foundational setup for the Universal Neural Intelligence Engine (UNI). It establishes the core structure of the engine and includes the configuration of the SQLite database used throughout the system.

This phase lays the groundwork for all future development by:
- Creating and initializing core database tables (`uni_intents`, `uni_patterns`, etc.)
- Preparing folder structure and virtual environment
- Serving as the bootstrapping point for the entire deterministic pipeline

No external services are needed in this phase. Everything runs locally and sets up the platform for further stages of intent recognition.
